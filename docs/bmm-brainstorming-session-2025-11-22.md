# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-22
**Facilitator:** Samus Shepard (Game Designer)
**Participant:** Dan

## Session Start

**Topic:** New game concept from scratch - "Expectant Father" Anthology
**Session Goals:** Explore the emotional journey of becoming a father and map these feelings to specific gameplay mechanics and genres.

## Executive Summary

We explored the core fantasy of the **Expectant Father**, focusing on the tension between **Excitement** (milestone, growth) and **Anxiety** (unknowns, support, self-change).

We decided on a **Multi-Genre Anthology** approach, where different aspects of the fatherhood experience are represented by distinct game genres that best convey the underlying emotion.

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Transition:** The shift from "Me" to "Us" to "Provider."
- **Vulnerability:** The feeling of being unprepared or overwhelmed.
- **Protection:** The active effort to create safety in a chaotic world.
- **Connection:** The struggle to connect with the partner and the unborn child.

## Idea Categorization: The Anthology

We identified 7 distinct archetypal experiences to include in the game:

### 1. The Provider (Anxiety/Resource Management)

- **Genre:** **Roguelike Deckbuilder** (e.g., _Slay the Spire_)
- **Concept:** Life deals "Event Cards" (needs, emergencies), and you play "Resource Cards" (money, energy, time).
- **Metaphor:** You can't play every card. Sacrifice is necessary. "Worry" cards clog your hand.

### 2. The Protector (Vigilance/Safety)

- **Genre:** **Auto-Runner / Pathfinder Puzzle** (e.g., _Lemmings_)
- **Concept:** The family moves forward automatically. You frantically clear obstacles and build bridges ahead of them.
- **Metaphor:** You can't stop time, only smooth the road. If you're too slow, they trip.

### 3. The Partner (Empathy/Support)

- **Genre:** **Rhythm Game** (e.g., _Friday Night Funkin'_ but slow)
- **Concept:** Hitting "listening nodes" in time with her speech to tune into her frequency.
- **Metaphor:** Active listening as a performance. Missed notes create distance.

### 4. The Role Model (Self-Growth)

- **Genre:** **Reverse RPG / Stat Decay**
- **Concept:** You start with high "Bad Traits" (Ego, Impatience) and must lose levels/XP in them.
- **Metaphor:** Fighting against your own old habits to become the person your son needs.

### 5. The Novice (Confusion/Learning)

- **Genre:** **WarioWare / Minigame Rush**
- **Concept:** Rapid-fire, confusing instructions for baby tasks (swaddle, car seat, bottle).
- **Metaphor:** The chaos of learning complex skills under pressure. Learning by failing.

### 6. The Outsider (Connection/Mystery)

- **Genre:** **Hidden Object / Signal Decoding**
- **Concept:** Scanning static-filled monitors (ultrasound) to find a clear signal.
- **Metaphor:** The struggle to feel connected to a reality you can't physically feel yet.

### 7. The Mourner (Letting Go)

- **Genre:** **Zen Packing / Unpacking**
- **Concept:** Choosing which "Old Life" items to discard to make space for "Baby Items."
- **Metaphor:** Making physical and emotional space. Letting go of the past self.

## Next Steps

- **Create Game Brief:** Formalize these concepts into a cohesive product vision.
- **Prototype Core Mechanics:** Pick one archetype (likely "The Provider" or "The Protector") to prototype first.
- **Narrative Weaving:** Determine how these distinct genres are tied together (e.g., a hub world, a linear timeline, or a framing device).
